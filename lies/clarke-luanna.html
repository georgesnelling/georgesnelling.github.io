<h1>Clark and Luahna</h1>

<p>
Pat is in the high-seventies on his quest for the top 100, so he's down
to really weird mountains that are hard to get to. However he has time
to plan and I don't so he usually wins. This weekend marked the first
climb of my fifth decade, and the trend is not good.
</p>

<p>To make a long story short, we did 28 miles and 9,000 vertical feet
in 36 hours, climibing Clark (8576) and Luahna (8400), two entirely
unremarkable, perfectly pretty mountains near glacier peak. And even
after blowing all my hard-earned cash on hyper-light gear to make up
for my being miserably out of shape because i spend all my time earning
cash, I still could not walk down stairs on monday morning. I sort of
teeter around trying not to bend any of my leg muscles. It's like
living a preview of what moving around will feel like when I'm 85 and
some smart-alec brat swipes my walker.
