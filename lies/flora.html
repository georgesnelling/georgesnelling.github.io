<p>So Becky describes Flora Mountain, number 100 on the Bulgar 100 list.
For Pat this was number 95. For me it was the first deep walk in the
woods since my son Col was born about a year ago. <br>
</p>
<p>There is no reason to climb Flora unless you are working the list.
It is hard to reach. It is unlovely. It is a big pile of small rocks.
Yet climbing it is strangely satisfying because it puts you in
atemporal yet intimate company with a strange clutch of misfits you
will never meet -- those who have stood on the same hard-to-reach spot
for the same worthless reason. Flora sumiteers untie! I mean unite! <br>

<p>Logistics: Ride the Lake Chelan ferry and bus to Holden Lutheran
Land. Find Fourth of July Basin. There is a climbers trail connecting
the two. People smarter than us use it. We bushwhacked. To reach Flora
from FOJB camp you have two options to bypass Riddle Peak's north
summit: a pass to the south or one to the north east. Descending the
former is loose, exposed, and dangerous. Approaching the latter is
tangled, arduous, and miserable. Pick your poison. We went out the
former and came back the latter. As a new dad, I would opt for safe and
miserable. Had I no children I would opt for the fast but sketchy.
