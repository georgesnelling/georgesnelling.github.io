Jack Mountain nags at Pat 'O'Brien like a sore toe. Not only does he
peek down coyly at Pat every time he drives the North Cascades highway,
at 9,044 feet, Jack parks stubbornly atop Pat's dwindling list of
unclimbed mountains in the state, and has so for a long, long time.
<br>

<br>
These alone would arouse only longing, not pain. The hurting comes
from Pat's two passes at Jack, both with me, both lugging ropes and
iron up 6000+ vertical feet from the miserable 1,900-foot trailhead,
neither of which gleaned so much as boot print on Jack's ass. That's
right, despite two full-on assaults, Pat's never so much as touched the
object of his desire, and it's driving him a little crazy.
<br>

<br>
Last year's failure was entirely my fault: I wore brand new boots
and they gnawed holes in my feet. We pushed the ultra-light fad a
little too far and enjoyed a capricious Cascade shower sans rain gear.
(Pat insists to this day that his Patagonia Dragonfly keeps out rain,
hah.) Beating our retreat we smooched Crater Mountain, Miss
Congeniality, but she failed to slack our lust for Jack. We vowed never
again to crank out that brutal approach without a bomber forecast and
comfortable shoes.
<br>

<br>
Adorning Jack's toes are Jerry Lakes, two gorgeous alpine gems.
Word is that some dude named Jerry hauled a rubberized canvas bucket
loaded with hundreds of swimming smelties up to these lakes long ago,
seeding his fishing habit. We convinced our loves, Nadia and Cherry, to
join us up to Jerry Lakes this year and either climb Jack or bask in
the sun as the mood struck.
<br>

<br>
Long story short: the entire state of Washington enjoyed a
beautiful, sunny weekend except for Jack Mountain. He rustled up his
own private nastiness and hosed us silly. The only good news is that
the competent fisherfolk in this state seem to prefer lakes that are
less than 6000 feet and a crevasse-riddled glacier away from their car,
and therefore Jerry Lakes teem with ravenous trouts who gobble up any
lure lobbed their way.
<br>

<br>
As fishers, we basically suck. Every single time I'd handled a fly
rod before I'd sunk a hook deep into innocent bystanding human flesh,
and Cherry had never caught a single fish. "They always come up, sniff
my hook, and swim away", she said gloomily. But not at Jerry Lakes: she
caught 10 trout in one hour on spinning gear purchased in a gas station
using a #1 Meps lure with a single barbless hook. If you can't catch
fish in Jerry lakes you should give up fishing. The major gear failure
of the trip was leaving home the big honkin frying pan.

So back we go next year....
