<h1>Tupshin and Devore</h1>

<p>
No, you have never heard of Tupshin or Devore. And why should you? They
are minor bumps in the vast wonderland that is the center of this
state, and you can't get anywhere near them using a car. They both post
rocks more than 8,300 feet above Puget Sound, earning them seats on
Washington State's 100-highest list. On Pat's promiscuous quest to kiss
every member, they occupy ignominious positions 97 and 98. </p>
<p>
The great joy of working the 100-highest list is that you go places
that are drop-dead gorgeous that you otherwise would never consider
going. The rotten thing is, as I've mentioned before, that the climbing
often SUCKS. OK, that's an exaggeration in this case. Climbing Tupshin
is only mildly rotten, and climbing Devore approaches downright fun. </p>

Technical beta Tupshin:
</p>

<p>
Books rate the main route class 5 but we soloed up and rapped down, as
did others according to summit register. Really just two 15-foot
sections of low fith class. Take just two or three cams if any. Main
danger is kicking rocks on your partners's heads. We used all 5 raps
down; would have been scary to downclimb. Loose. Kicked off small
blocks on rap 2 that snipped 5 excess meters from a 60 meter rope. </p>

Technical Beta Devore:
</p>
<p>
Although technically easier, more remote-feeling and grander, with more
interesting route finding and more solid rock. We all soloed up in dry
weather without much trepidation. Pat and I rapped down two pitches.
Lee downclimbed it all far faster. </p>

Pat, pushing 60, like Becky, Messner, and Bonatti, has burned through
many a good partner, each of whom has had what he or she considered to
be a long and mostly happy climbing career. But we all just wear out
after a while. It is the nature of time. And yet Pat, like other odd
old bulls in various fields of human endeavor, keeps on trudging
uphill, long past where the sensible animals have lain down to munch
nearby flowers, soon to fertilize grass. </p>
<p>
Whatever happened to the unlucky punk who caught Dirty Harry's final
slug? Nobody remembers, but Clint still makes movies. Who marshaled
Fidel's army against Kennedy? Eight presidents have come and gone, and
that guy is long dead, yet Fidel still runs Cuba. What woman on earth
denied Mick the seminal satisfaction? She's forgotten, but Mick's pants
cling tight as ever. And Pat O'Brien still climbs mountains. His
endurance and perseverance must be measured not just against legendary
climbers, but against the truly great old farts of our time. </p>

<p>
As Pat's latest old partner, 16 years his junior, I'm plum wore out.
Lee is taking over. I spent every ounce of gumption I could muster
trying not to slow them down, and failed. I can now testify with full
conviction: rigorously changing diapers is an insufficient training
regimen for keeping pace with Pat and Lee.
