<h1>Remmel, Amphitheater and Cathedral</h1>

<p>
Pat and I climbed Remmel (8685, class 4), Amphitheater (8358, horse
trail), and the Southeast Buttress of Cathedral (8601, 12 pitches of
5.7 and 5.8) last week. </p>

<p>
Trailhead is Andrews creek, 20 miles north of Winthrop. First thing we
noticed when we arrived at the parking lot was that unlike all the
other people, we had forgotten our horses. We were one of the two
vehicles at the trail head not sporting a horse trailer. The other 12
trucks came packing horse meat. </p>

<p>
Undaunted (or at least committed), we lugged out the big !McHales with
a big ole rack, double 8 climbing ropes, and 9 days of food. We later
found out that you can hire a mule for $100 / day who can carry 250lbs
of stuff. Look for a mule-powered trip next year! </p>

<p>
It's 20 miles in to Cathedral lakes. The trails are all like the PCT:
wide, gentle grade, and dusty from decaying horse manure returning to
the earth. Lot's of horse people passed us, looked at our packs, and
shook their heads. Both of us developed blisters, which we hadn't done
in a long time. I blamed the heavy pack, not the fact that i've spent
the entire summer on the sofa watching west wing. </p>

<p>
Day 3 we scrambled the NW ridge of Remmel. It's got a couple of grippy
class 4 moves, but otherwise goes easily. There's a horse trail up the
south ridge. That night a yearling buck dear meandered fearlessly into
our camp browsing for pee salt. We tried to scare him away by
explaining to him what would happen to him if he kept approaching
people within an hour's drive of Winthop but he appeared unconcerned.
We named him Not-Long-For-This-World. </p>

<p>
Day 4 we moved camp to some great granite slabs just to the NE of
Cathedral lake. There's a small lakelette up there for cooking water
and less delicate vegetation than near the main lake, plus it's removed
from the popular horse campsite at the west end of Cathedral lake. </p>

<p>
Day 5 was a pretty walk up Amphitheater. It's a spiral shaped mountain
with 4 spoke ridges. The north side of the West ridge is a beautiful
granite cliff, 800 - 1000 feet tall, ending in Cathedral lake. Many,
many rock routes up that cliff face. Big views from the top, especially
as you can walk along the whole cliff face for almost a mile. </p>

<p>
The big climb was the southeast Buttress of Cathedral. We hit the rock
at 8:30 am and didn't top out until 5. It's a bunch of short pitches,
most of them easy to protect. In places the rock is not as solid as
Becky would lead you to believe. Horns exposed to the weather were
sometimes brittle and crumbly, but the rock inside cracks was bomber as
could be. Even with heavily taped hands we were pretty chewed up by the
cracks. We used twin 8s, which worked great, and a medium sized rack w
#.5 - #3 black diamond cams, plus stoppers and a few tri-cams. There
were a couple of cracks where a #4 would have been nice, but we could
generally find alternatives. We thought the ratings were on the low
side (either that or we were off route or perhaps just plain wussy).
</p>

<p>We swung leads, with Pat conveniently taking most of the 8s and me
the 7s. After leading the 2nd pitch, i somehow lost the pages to the
guide book. This is not a good idea. Much head scratching ensued as we
went up trying to decide where the route was supposed to lead (there
are *lots* of options), but luckily Pat had read it about 6 times and
his age-induced dementia was temporarily reversed by fear of death, and
he pulled us through. </p>

<p>
At the very top there's a 2-pitch, 5.9 wall that you can bypass by
moving right and searching around for a 5.6 - .7 chimney. Lot's of
poking around on the pointy end of the rope hoping that the route
doesn't dead end, but if you keep at it, the chimney is findable, and
we gladly rode it up. </p>

<p>
Walkoff the back side is non-trivial. We rapped one pitch down. Becky
claims there's a 4th class ascent up the back, but I'd want a rope for
sure. </p>

<p>
Hiked out in two days on very sore feet. Still craving salt, our friend
Not-Long-For-This-World ate Pat's ski pole staps while we slept the
last night at Andrews pass. Just consider for a moment the grossness of
what i just wrote. Yuck! Pat cursed him to spend enternity gazing over
the cool green felt of some basement game room pool table, and I bet he
gets his wish.
</p>

<p>Only bad part of the trip was not bringing a mule. This is a great
area to basecamp into and do a *lot* of climbing. There's lots o trout
in the lakes, one of whom took my lure and gave his or her life to
provide us very tasty ordourves.
