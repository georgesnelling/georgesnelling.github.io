<h1>Shucksan</h1>
<p>
Phil Armiger, Martian Jambrichova, Cherry, and I climbed Shuksan (9131)
last weekend and skied down. Bugs drank deeply of our blood as we
humped from the trailhead at 2600 to the first snow at 5500. Gloom and
Misery. Bliss commenced at snowline. We pitched camp around 6500 ft,
(accidentally, i swear) just above a phenomenally placed composting
pooper, offering great views not only of baker, baker lake, and all
mountains west, but also the embarrassed backsides of all fellow
climbers on the route as nature called. we have photos....
</p>
<p>I highly recommend camping with Phil. After last week's hump-fest
with Pat I wasn't bringing one extra gram on this climb i didn't
absolutely require so survive, so i was delighted when Phil popped from
his pack not 1, not 2, but 5 bottles of beer and 1 bottle of red wine!
Now that's climbing!
</p>
<p>We talked with a group of Colorado climbers (between poops) who were
prepping for Rainier. They were convinced they needed to rise early,
climb, and descend before the snow bridges melted out the next morning,
as they would on the Big Fella, and were therefore going to rise at 2am
and get going. We didn't have the heart to inform them that there
weren't any dangerous hidden crevasses on this peak, so we heartily
approved of their plan, sent them on their way, drank some beer and
wine, told stories, and went to bed around 11. </p>
<p>
Rising at 9 or 9:30, we discovered that our Colorado friends seemed to
have already summitted and descended safely. we drank coffee and
plotted. around 11 cherry started to get really mad at Phil and me for
dawdling, so we shifted into 2nd gear and packed to go. </p>
<p>
The snow route is clean and safe if you watch for the big ones. We had
skis, skins, harnesses, axes, 25M of spectra cord, and 3 rock pieces.
Phil and Cherry had climbed it before. Martina and I had not. Phil
hadn't packed skins and walked up. Cherry and I started skinning, but
due to glue problems, and the fact that Phil was beating us up the
hill, we doffed the skis and started walking about 7,500 ft. We reached
the rock at 3:00. </p>
<p>
We never roped up on the glacier. crevasses were either enormous and
easily spotted and skirted, or 6 inches across and easily stepped over.
There's one steepish snow pitch before the summit gully that commands
full attention. The rock gully is mostly class 3, with a few class 4
parts and lots of loose stuff. The rock-pro was dead weight.
</p>
<p>As the sole party selecting a noon start, we found ourselves alone,
so the only rock fall we had to worry about was our own. This was Good
Planning. The summit gully is three pitches or so of steep funnellish
scramble, so even well-meaning chaps above you can kill your ass with a
minor misstep by innocently dislodging a
chunk-o-shuksan-aimed-at-yo-head. </p>
<p>
Martina, goddess on skis, didn't like the rock bowling alley, and opted
to tan while the three of us tagged the top. Only time we used the rope
was to rap down the previously mentioned steep snow slope. It's a full
pitch, and if you only bring a 25M rope, the last person has to descend
unroped. Two tools are nice here. </p>
<p>
Back to the snow, the ski down was greasy, glorious, orgasmic nirvana.
(i just got punched for writing that) Cherry and I had to work Monday,
so we reached camp, packed up, and skied / hiked out Sunday night,
sneaking past the bugs while they were snug in bed, finally plopping
exhausted on our front porch at 2:00 am Monday morning. Wiser, Phil and
Martina stayed an extra day and skied out Monday like decent citizens. </p>
<p>
Other than feeding about a million blackflies our life's essence, twas a fine trip.
