Ann Williamson, on turing 50, decided she wanted to stand on top of Mt.
Rainier once more, just to tell the big boy she was still Boss. I
joined in, along with Mike Balise and four freshly minted grads of the
2005 WAC Basic Climbing Class: Andy Iles, Miles Ohlrich, Gilbert
Weidinger, and Robert Buessow. Of 6 parties camped at Sherman/Emmons
that night, only Team WAC was foolhardy enough to suit up and stumble
up through the blowing snot that greeted the wee hours of July 26th,
2006. </p>

To our great luck, the nastiness was imprisoned below 12,000 feet by a
blessed high-pressure wind, and we climbed up into glorious, balmy
sunshine all the way to summit. </p>

I guess the moral of the story is Go When It Sucks. You never know what
might happen -- you might have it all to yourself. </p>
