Pat, Nadia and I dashed up Big Craggy (8470) and West Craggy (8360) in
a day in august. Very easy to tag 2 of the 100 highest in a day w great
views. buggy start. cool beautiful finish. Jonathan tells us he
summited big craggy but couldn't find the summit register. We didn't
seem to have any trouble. :)
