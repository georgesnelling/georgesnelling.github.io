Robin Evans-Agnew and i tagged Ingals last Friday. In fine Scottish
style: With a peremptory, "Whaut th' hell y' need thouuse frikn fancy
friends fur? My trusty nuts'll du th' job fer a thrd th' price!" Robin
emptied my rack of anything resembling modern climbing gear and off we
went. </p>

Teanaway Road is melted out to within 1/2 mile of the trail head. Good
firm snow all the way to the base of the climb makes the approach much
easier than normal. Snowshoes were unnecessary. Skis would have been
great. </p>

Stewart looked beautiful and foreboding, it's top shrouded in nasty
clouds most of the day. True to form for the year, the weather got
worse the closer we got to the summit, culminating in the now routine
summit whiteout. Descending, of course, improved the weather, and by
the time we left the basin the top was clear.

<p>Ingals is a great beginning climb. There's some route finding, great
views, and two pitches of clean, easily protectable rock (5.4 -- can do
it in hiking boots). Note that the bottom pitch has a
longer-than-one-rope rappel, so either bring two ropes or be prepared
to downclimb about 40 feet of 5.4. You can do it as a day trip from
seattle if you leave early, don't get lost on the approach, and don't
get stuck in line on the rock.
