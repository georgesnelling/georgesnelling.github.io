I climbed Buck (8528), Berge (7948), and Fortress (8760) a few weeks
ago over a 4 day solo trip. Was hoping for Chiwawa (8459) as well but
poor route-finding cost me a day. All these sit between Glacier and the
Bonanza, Seven-Finger Jack, Maude massive, and views of these big-uns
dominate the climb. In August and September the Buck Creek basin is
popular with equestrians, so go early or go dungy.
</p>

<p>Buck West Shoulder beta: Goldman recommends approaching Buck by
hiking all the way to Buck Creek Pass (10 m) and then traversing back
to Buck via High Pass and Berge. I now understand why. Becky in Guide
2, third edition, page 175, begins his Buck West Shoulder route
description thus: "Follow Buck Creek Trail for 10 minutes past the
5-mi. mark, to the large slide track (good camp by stream just below
trail beyond slide). Cross Buck Creek and hike SW upward through heavy
timber toward mount Berge...."
</p>
<p>There is no longer any 5-mi mark that I could find. Replace his
first two sentences with these and save yourself about 2 hours
wandering around: "Follow Buck Creek Trail approximately 5 mi. to a
large slide track following a set of switchbacks. Descend slide track
to Buck Creek. Cross at good camp site and hike SW upward through heavy
timber toward mount Berge."
</p>

<p>After I finally convinced myself that I'd found the right crossing,
I did a stupid, stupid thing, one I've done before and will probably do
again, thick-headed dolt that i am: I got pissed at Becky's route
description's ambiguity, and fed up, decided to ignore it and find my
own way. The rest of his paragraph is extremely detailed for a reason:
all other paths lead through alder hell.<img alt="" src="http://www.georgesnelling.net/pictures/climb/2004/buck/.piccache/IMG_0827_338x450.JPG">
</p>
<p>The setting sun found me exhausted, shredded and bleeding, totally
disgusted with myself, building a miserable camp on a lumpy, muddy bivy
site in a wash, literally surrounded by cliffs and endless, tangled
alder thickets. Imagine how depressing it is to go to sleep all by
yourself knowing that in the morning the first thing you'll have to do
is battle alder up a totally unknown slope that may or may not go, and
if it doesn't you've got nothing but an endless alder battle just to
get out. Not my best day.
</p>
<p>Next morning went OK, and I escaped purgatory after only a couple of
hours trashing, getting back on route at the end of that one cursed
little paragraph from page 175: "...up the open basin." The summit of
Buck is very fun, mainly because it's enormous and so damn hard to get
to you're virtually guaranteed solitude. Looking down over the North
face sucks your breath way it's so huge and awesome. The summit
register's sat up there for 25 years and is only half full. Recognized
Al Erington name from 85, and WAC'ers Jonathan Pryce, Fred Slater, and
Anne Herrick from last year, but no others. I think this is the only
top 100 mt I've climbed that Pat hasn't, which of course is cool.
</p>
<p>Headed back to Barge. Goldman says it's not a scramble and "should
be avoided". Becky says "Here is a short, exposed rock climb (class
3)." Brought a light rappelling setup: 25M of spectra, diaper sling
harness, one locker for a munter hitch, and rap tape, but didn't use
it. The route up and down is class 3, and is a fine scramble if you're
careful. I'm starting to think that when Goldman says "scramble" she
means "climber's trail". Barge's summit is quite beautiful, though too
pointy for crowds or lounging, and the rock is generally more sound
than Buck or Fortress.
</p>

<p>Then I got lost again. In late season there's a nice climber's path
from Berge to High Pass, but steep snow buried the trail and the normal
route looked too slidey to descend safely, so i wandered around to the
south searching for another way down. Ended up on well off-route and
cliffed out, but atop a lovely flat bulge with good water perched
directly across a valley from Napeequ and Cirque.<img alt="" src="http://www.georgesnelling.net/pictures/climb/2004/buck/.piccache/IMG_0854_338x450.JPG">
</p>
<p>Next day rose early, found a way down off my nubbin to the basin
south of High Pass, and traversed back to Buck Creek Pass. Early season
snow slowed progress as i was forced to don and doff crampons many
times. Finally picked up the track of a large deer who'd passed the
night before on some errand whose footprints had frozen into excellent
pockets that would hold my bare boot across steep sections. Nice dear.
Made it to Buck Creek Pass by 11am. My plan had been to camp there the
night before and do Fortress and Chiwawa the next day, but with that
plan blown, I collapsed into a delicious nap.
</p>

<p>Took off for Fortress with just snow and rap gear about 1pm and
promptly got lost again. Sheesh! There's a climbers tail that winds
around some cliff bands, (Becky's "hanging garden") that fence the
entrance to the "wide snowpatched basin". But in tune with the theme of
this trip, I lost it under snow. Wound up executing class 4-ish
waterfall moves bulling straight up the garden, squirting a little more
adrenaline that I wanted. Made it to the basin, and then easy, though
steep, up-up to the summit ridge. Main danger by far was avalanche. Top
layer was unconsolidated and sloughy, but there was no clear shear
layer i could find underneath. Everything held OK and I was up by 4,
down by 5:30, traversing around the hanging garden this time, picking
up bits of the climbers' path that had melted through.<img alt="" src="http://www.georgesnelling.net/pictures/climb/2004/buck/.piccache/IMG_0861_338x450.JPG">
</p>
<p>Hike out next day was as easy as 10 miles can be. I think this area
might be best in July, before the horse folk take over, but after the
high trails poke out a bit more from beneath the snow. </p>
